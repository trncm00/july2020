					<p>Welcome to the month of July, my name is Terence Minerbrook. I have made it a point to work on monthly websites. So over the next few weeks, there should be changes. Then I will move on to a new website for the following month.<br> 
						I have been taking a math course called Computational Thinking on Coursera. I am in week six. It has been a challenge, but I never saw myself making magic squares or learning mathematical induction before.<br> 
                        I just finished the first part of a five course Introduction to Computer Science. It was a general class, with basic algorithms, Fermat's Last Theorem, magic squares. It took two months. I really have to re-learn algebra where I left it because sometimes the professor, Alexander Shen, would do things that made no sense to me. They hurt my brain a bit, like a bright light was shining in my eyes.<br>

  <h1>Hey there July, I.</h1>
  <p>I remember when I first got into computers, it was when my father had his apple backed up, back in what must have been 89 or thereabouts. He had this dude with a beard and earth shoes come by. I don't know where he got him, he hustled him from off the LIRR or something and got him to back up this 50 pound computer he kept his professional work on. I think it might have been because I magnetized the thing, or that was an earlier incident, not related. Any way, I come in and the guy had the computer backing up on tape reel to reels. Or that is how I remember it, this was well before you could back up a computer by pressing a button, I just remember the guy hunched over the keyboard typing in commands. I had never seen it's like, and I was shooed away before long but what I had witnessed stuck with me for the rest of my life.   </p>

  <h1>Hey there July, II.</h1>
  <p>I grew up in an area of Central Islip. It was a nice area mostly, diverse for Long Island, close to a large national park and forty-five minutes to Queens by car. It was a lucky thing, but the town had it's foibles. Central Islip was weak to addiction and when you went up around the Pilgrim's you had to be on your guard. When we were young, my friends and I wouldn't ride up past Lowell avenue, though we would run far afield, for miles and miles, in every other direction.<br> Now there is a condominium and a nature path and a big courthouse, a huge development for the area, which has struggled with poverty over the years. But the bloody past of the Pilgrims Mental Institution came back a few years ago, at least in my mind, when a group of young men were brutally murdered steps away from the L.E.A.P Center, a program my brother and I attended after school when we were in Mulvey Elementary school. The murder, MS-13 related, was a setup orchestrated by the gang in revenge for a perceived slight. It drew the eye of the Trump administration, and imagine my surprise when I saw Jeff Sessions in Central Islip, looking stern, promising to root out MS-13 on tv. What he meant was that we would unleash ICE on Central Islip. What ended up happening was they got a teenager to inform on the guys who did it. And they weren't much older than him, this was kids in kids kind of stuff, with machetes and pipes and things. Apparently he was deported after he cooperated, concerned that he would end up thrown in with the guys whose organization he had betrayed.  </p>

  <h1>Hey there July, III.</h1>
  <p> When I saw my first lawn jockey it was somewhere near where I grew up and I was young enough that it frightened me. The black lawn jockies seemed perverse, low peering, subservient, red-lipped, daubed with black paint and in the dark they seemed animated as we passed them by. Years passed with me watching the world go by from the backseat and one day I asked my parents. They didn't really have an answer that sticks with me today, "These people out here are crazy." They had already made me aware, dad's Mom was white and his father was black. My Mother's parent's were from St.Vincent and they were black. It was clear to me what was going on there with the little man and his lantern. What was not clear was the connection between equatriana and black servitude, the place where black people worked in the antebellum south such that the role was caricatured in this form.<br>

				<p style="">They bob up and down at the waist with little gasps. Working green shoots out of the stony soil with their hands they pull out carrots, potatoes and turnips. Caked with clumps, which some men fleck away with spades, or rough, hardy knives. The vegetables are handled with enormous care, and placed in canvas sacks.<br> 
	One man straightens his back with a slight groan. His hood falls back a little and he pushes it all the way down with the backs of his hands. He has thick black eyebrows and brown eyes. He has a bird peak jutting over down-turned lips. He wears his hair bowl cut, and there is a large piebald spot on the crown of his skull. <br> 
	There are treetops very close by, and as the wind rises to shake them, they creak and groan in a terrific display and for a moment, he feels terrific sympathy.<br> 
	He looks down into the distant valley. The sun comes through the clouds in great, silver-tinted columns, which disappear and reappear until they pool on an undivided, green land. Irregular flecks of yellow and white, chipped out of a great green table. He stepped closer to the edge of the terraced farm. “There are such tantalizing shapes”, he thought.
