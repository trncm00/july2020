					<p>Welcome to the month of July. I have made it a point to work on monthly websites. So over the next few weeks, there should be changes. Then I will move on to a new website for the following month.<br> 
						I have been taking a math course called Computational Thinking on Coursera. I am in week six. It has been a challenge, but I never saw myself making magic squares or learning mathematical induction before.<br>

				<p>They bob up and down at the waist with little gasps. Working green shoots out of the stony soil with their hands they pull out carrots, potatoes and turnips. Caked with clumps, which some men fleck away with spades, or rough, hardy knives the vegetables are handled with enormous care.<br> 
	One straightens his back with a slight groan. His hood falls back a little and he pushes it all the way down with the backs of his hands. He has thick black eyebrows and brown eyes. He has a bird peak jutting over down-turned lips. He wears his hair bowl cut, and there is a large piebald spot on the crown of his skull. <br> 
	There are treetops very close by, and as the wind rises to shake them, they creak and groan in a terrific display and for a moment, he feels terrific sympathy.<br> 
	He looks down into the distant valley. The sun comes through the clouds in great, silver-tinted columns, which disappear and reappear until they pool on an undivided, green land. Irregular flecks of yellow and white, chipped out of a great green table. He stepped closer to the edge of the terraced farm. “There are such tantalizing shapes”, he thought.
